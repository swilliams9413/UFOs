# UFOs

# Overview 
To create a webpage that includes an article and a dynamic table that can be filtered by date, city, state, country, and shape of UFO.

# Results
To search for a particular UFO sighting, you simply enter at least one of the parameters into the filter. A list of UFO sightings will appear matching the parameter(s) entered.

# Summary

One drawback of the webpage is that the table's data is limited to US sightings. It would be helpfull and relevant to readers if there was data on sighting in Canada, and Mexico. I would recommend adding an ascending/decscending sort function. That would make determining things like the most recent sighting an easier task. I also recommend adding a legend for the shape category. I think some readers may find it hard to visualize the difference between a "light" shape and a "fireball" shape.
